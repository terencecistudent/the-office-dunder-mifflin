# Dunder Mifflin US

## Description

## Cloning and Pushing To The Respository

### Cloning:

- Here is a link how to clone a repository:
  https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

### Pushing To The Respository:

- To add, commit and push files to the repository, e.g. index.html, open a New Terminal and type:

1. git add index.html
2. git commit -m "Leave a message here"
3. git push origin master - (which is for the master branch).

- To create a new branch within your current application, open a New Terminal:

1. Create a branch: git checkout -b new-branch-name
2. Edit, add to your application and commit the files.
3. Push the branch to the remote repository: git push origin new-branch-name.

## Roadmap

In the future I would like to implement:

- Better UX design.
- Using a SQL database to store information in instead of a JSON file.
- More validaton for the contact form.
